  "thesis": "Developer teams are actively migrating away from Kubernetes to simpler deployment solutions like Kamal and Docker Compose. The primary driver is cost reduction (70%+ savings reported) and complexity reduction (90%+ reported). This creates opportunities in the deployment simplification tooling space.",
  "friction_detail": "Primary friction in K8s ecosystem: operational complexity, cost overhead for small/medium teams, steep learning curve. Teams report 90% complexity reduction after migration, suggesting K8s is significantly over-engineered for most use cases.",
  "gap_analysis": "Current tools like Kamal and Docker Compose handle basic deployments but lack K8s-like reliability guarantees. No tool currently offers automated K8s-to-simple migration, incompatibility detection, or rollback support in a simple package.",
  "timing_signal": "Mention velocity at 3.2x baseline over the past 48 hours, up from 1.8x last week. Sentiment shifted negative by 0.35 points. This is an accelerating signal — the conversation is growing, not plateauing.",
  "risk_factors": [
    "Large enterprises with dedicated platform teams unlikely to migrate",
    "Kubernetes ecosystem continues to improve developer experience",
    "Market may consolidate around 1-2 winners quickly"

  "competitive_landscape": "Kamal (Rails-centric, limited to Ruby ecosystem), Docker Compose (manual config, no deployment orchestration), Coolify (self-hosted PaaS, early stage). No tool addresses the K8s migration path specifically.",
  "opportunity_type": "migration_aid",
  "mvp_scope": "A single CLI tool that migrates a Docker Compose setup from K8s to Kamal with one command — detect services, generate Kamal config, verify connectivity.",
  "monetization_angle": "Freemium with a free tier for single-service apps and a paid tier ($29/mo) for multi-service setups. Enterprise tier for custom migration consulting.",
  "target_buyer": "DevOps-averse solo founders and small teams running 2-5 services on K8s who dread their next kubectl session. Triggered by their next unexpected cloud bill.",
  "distribution_channels": "r/selfhosted, HN Show threads, Docker community Slack, Rails-adjacent Twitter. Partner with Kamal and Coolify communities where migration discussions are happening.",
