The real opportunity is a hyper-personalized, proactive AI agent that integrates across a solo builder's specific tools (like Replit, GitHub, Notion, Calendar) to not just answer questions, but observe your work and proactively suggest code improvements, draft project updates, or even spot market trends relevant to your current project based on your entire digital footprint. You could start by building a personal 'AI project manager' that monitors a builder's GitHub repo and associated project docs (e.g., in Notion), then uses an LLM (large language model, a type of AI that understands and generates human-like text) to suggest the next logical task or flag potential issues, sending these as daily digests or Discord messages, like a 'LazyGravity' for project management.",

Given that agents are solving CAPTCHAs and even deanonymizing people online, there's a massive need for a simple 'agent activity monitor' — a user-friendly dashboard that logs every action an agent takes, especially when it interacts with personal data or external services (APIs, which are just ways software talks to other software). You could build a basic version this weekend by creating a lightweight proxy that intercepts and logs agent requests, giving users peace of mind as agents become more integrated into real-world tasks.",
