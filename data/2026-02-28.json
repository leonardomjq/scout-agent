People aren't just looking for AI to build new apps; they want it to make their existing tools safer and more reliable.",

Think a local-first version control that catches *every* change, even uncommitted ones, and lets you rewind instantly within tools like Cursor or Replit. Ship a VS Code extension that hooks into file system events and offers granular rollback of AI-generated edits, and you'll own the 'AI safety net' for builders.",
