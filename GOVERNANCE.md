# Governance

## Overview

Overheard is maintained by a single developer. This document describes how decisions are made and how the project is run.

## Maintainer

Leonardo Jaques ([@leonardomjq](https://github.com/leonardomjq)) — sole maintainer and project lead.

## Decision-Making

- **Small changes** (typos, docs, bug fixes with obvious solutions) — merged directly by the maintainer.
- **New features** — discussed in a GitHub issue before implementation. Open a feature request to propose your idea.
- **Breaking changes** — require an RFC issue with a description of the change, motivation, and migration path. These stay open for at least 7 days for community feedback before merging.

## Scope

Overheard is a **free, open-source, static site** that publishes AI-generated opportunity briefs. It is:

- Not a SaaS product
- Not a paid service
- Not financial or investment advice

The project intentionally stays simple: no database, no auth, no payments. Contributions that move toward SaaS complexity will be declined.

## Becoming a Co-Maintainer

Sustained, quality contributions over 3+ months may lead to a co-maintainer invitation from the current maintainer. There is no formal application process — it happens organically through demonstrated commitment and good judgment.

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
